"This notebook was created based on the PyGMT tutorials (https://www.pygmt.org/latest/gallery/images/cross_section.html#sphx-glr-gallery-images-cross-section-py). In addition to that, we have incorporated some code snippets obtained from the GMT forum to visualize earthquake data in a depth section (https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/t/help-me-with-cross-section-plot/2391/2). Please feel free to make any further modifications or additions."
